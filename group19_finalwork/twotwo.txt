  <h2> Directions/Hours of Operation: </h2>
  <p>There are many locations to try Two Two Fried Chicken in Seoul since it is a franchised restaurant.
   However, the main place is in Myungdong (the most popular shopping place, especially for foreigners),
   located at 138 Da-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea. Since Korean chicken is known to match well with beer, chicken restaurants
   in Korea usually open late afternoon and close during the early morning. Myungdong Two Two Fried Chicken is open everyday from 3 pm to 2 am.
