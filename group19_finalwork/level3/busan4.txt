  <h2> Directions/Hours of Operation</h2>
  <p>OPS Bakery is located in various areas in Busan. However, the most famous place is the one that is located beside the beautiful Haeundae beach. The address is 31 Jungdong 1-ro, Jung 1-dong Haeundae, Busan, South Korea. Since it is located beside the beach, OPS is one of the preferred places to grab a little snack after swimming. 
OPS Haeundae is open everyday from 8 am to 11 pm. Please note that each hour, fresh baked breads come out so it would be better to aim for the fresh breads although everything at OPS is scrumptious.
